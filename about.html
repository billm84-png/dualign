                    <h3>I've Sat in Your Chair</h3>
                    <p>I've spent more than 30 years building businesses and leading teams through the kinds of challenges that don't come with a playbook.</p>
                    <p>My executive career spans roles as a founder, divisional leader, CTO, COO and CEO. I've led global organizations through acquisitions, economic downturns, AI adoption and operational meltdowns. I've made the 3am decisions that couldn't wait until morning and walked into rooms where everyone expected answers I didn't have yet.</p>
                    <p>I've stared at a revenue forecast that dropped 25% overnight and addressed a company of 3,200 people with honesty instead of spin. I've flown to a client site for a 72-hour crisis recovery. I've built a business from a whiteboard pitch into a division that generated half the company's revenue.</p>
                    <p>Today, I partner with Boards, CEOs, founders, and executive teams at $20M&ndash;$1B companies who are navigating growth, transformation, or transition. My fractional executive practice provides senior-level strategic guidance without the commitment or cost of a full-time hire.</p>

                    <h3>Why Dualign</h3>
                    <p>The name says it all: <strong>Dual</strong> + <strong>Align</strong>. Leadership demands two forces that often feel at odds: the people instincts to build trust, retain talent, and lead through uncertainty, and the analytical rigor to make hard decisions, optimize performance, and drive results. Most leaders lean one way or the other. The best learn to align both.</p>
                    <p>That's what I help you do. I work with executives to integrate culture-driven leadership with analytical rigor, not as competing priorities, but as complementary strengths. When heart and head work together, you build organizations where people thrive <em>and</em> the numbers work.</p>

                    <h3>How I Work</h3>
                    <p>I partner with leaders as a fractional executive and strategic advisor, bringing C-suite experience without the full-time overhead. Whether you need a thinking partner for strategic decisions, someone to design and implement operating rhythms, or a steady hand through transformation, I embed with your team and work alongside you.</p>
                    <p>My areas of focus include strategic planning and execution, leadership operating rhythms, AI adoption for enterprise, board services (including Government Security Committee Outside Diector roles for FOCI-mitigated companies), and executive coaching and mentoring.</p>

                    <h3>Now in Your Corner</h3>
                    <p>I know what it's like when the forecast doesn't add up, when the team is looking to you for direction, and when the weight of the business feels like it's yours alone to carry. I bring battle-tested experience and practical frameworks to help leaders get through the challenges that feel impossible.</p>
