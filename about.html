                    <h3>I've Sat in Your Chair</h3>
                    <p>I've spent more than 30 years building businesses and leading teams through the kinds of inflection points that don't come with a playbook.</p>
                    <p>My executive career spans roles as a founder, divisional leader, CTO, COO and CEO. I've led global organizations through acquisitions, economic downturns, AI adoption and operational meltdowns. I've made the 3am decisions that couldn't wait until morning and walked into rooms where everyone expected answers I didn't have yet.</p>
                    <p>I've stared at a revenue forecast that dropped 25% overnight and addressed a company of 3,200 people with honesty instead of spin. I've flown to client sites for crisis recoveries. I've built a business from a whiteboard pitch into a division that generated half the company's revenue.</p>
                    <p>Today, I partner with boards, CEOs, founders, owners and executive teams at $20M&ndash;$1B companies who are navigating scale, transformation, or transition. Dualign provides senior-level operational leadership without the commitment or cost of a full-time hire.</p>

                        <h3>Proven Theses</h3>
                        <div class="thesis-card">
                            <h4>"AI is an operational challenge, not a technical one."</h4>
                            <p>The board doesn't need to know how LLMs work; they need to know how AI changes their unit economics and liability profile.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="thesis-card">
                            <h4>"Leadership friction is a hidden tax on EBITDA."</h4>
                            <p>When a C-suite is misaligned, every decision takes longer and costs more. Alignment removes the friction eating your margins.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="thesis-card">
                            <h4>"The 'Founder Gap' is the most dangerous stage of growth."</h4>
                            <p>Where founder-led intuition starts to fail but professional systems haven't taken hold. Bridging this gap without killing the company's soul is the work.</p>

                            <h4>"'Heart' is a risk management tool."</h4>
                            <p>Psychological safety isn't about being nice. It's about ensuring your VP of Ops isn't afraid to tell you a $10M project is failing.</p>

                    <h3>Why Dualign</h3>
                    <p>The name says it all: <strong>Dual</strong> + <strong>Align</strong>. Leadership demands two forces that often feel at odds: the people instincts to build trust, retain talent, and lead through uncertainty, and the analytical rigor to make hard decisions, optimize performance, and drive results. Most leaders lean one way or the other. The best learn to align both.</p>
                    <p>When heart and head are misaligned, the cost shows up on the P&L: slower decisions, higher attrition, missed quarters, and transformation programs that stall. I work with executives to close those gaps &mdash; not as a philosophical exercise, but as a direct lever on operating performance.</p>

                    <h3>How I Work</h3>
                    <p>We produce operational clarity, not slide decks. Whether you need an embedded fractional operator for a 12&ndash;24 week engagement, a thinking partner for strategic decisions, or a steady hand through a post-acquisition integration, I work alongside your team to build systems that run without me.</p>
                    <p>My areas of focus include strategic planning and execution, leadership operating rhythms, AI governance and operationalization, board services (including Government Security Committee Outside Director roles for FOCI-mitigated companies), and CEO/founder advisory.</p>

                    <h3>Now in Your Corner</h3>
                    <p>I know what it's like when the forecast doesn't add up, when the team is looking to you for direction, and when the weight of the business feels like it's yours alone to carry. Every inflection point I've navigated &mdash; from crisis recovery to PE-backed scale-up &mdash; is now available to help you move faster and with more confidence.</p>
